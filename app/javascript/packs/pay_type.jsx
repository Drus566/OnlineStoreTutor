// Due to how Turbolinks works, that event isnâ€™t fired every time our page is
// reloaded. Turbolinks manages the page-loading events for us and instead
// fires the turbolinks:load event. If you were to use DOMContentLoaded , then
// navigate away from the page, and then use the back button, the page would
// not properly set up React and nothing would work. Using turbolinks:load
// ensures that React is set up every time the page is rendered.
